# Explain Selection Extension

Built when I was bored. Saw an Instagram reel on how easy it is to build Chrome extensions.

## How to use

Clone this Github repository.

You must have an OpenAI API key for this to work. Get one first if you don't have one already.

Then, go to `chrome://extensions`, click "Load unpacked", and select the folder where you've cloned it.

## Testing

Go to any webpage, select text, then click on the extension. You should only need to paste your OpenAI API key once (I can't see it in any way, you can check the code to verify this) and then you can hit the explain button.

Doesn't have that many features, but was just something I thought I would try coding.
